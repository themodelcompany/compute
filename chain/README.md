## Chain Core (MVP)

This module is an in-memory reference implementation of chain logic:
- Worker registration
- Job creation
- Receipt submission
- Challenge assignment
- Verification handling
- Reward and slashing accounting

It is intended for development and integration tests before a full consensus
implementation is chosen.
